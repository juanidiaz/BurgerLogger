## DESCRIPTION
This **FULL STACK** project is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This application allow the user to create a burger with any name, this new burger will be shown on a list on the left side of the screen. Then the user can click on a button to "Devour" the burger, thus moving it to the right column.

The app, while looking very silly and simple uses SQL commands to handle the creation and management of the items.... Bon App√©tit!!
